# Netflix Data Analysis

I created this interactive dashboard using Tableau and the Netflix Titles dataset from Kaggle. It provides a clear overview of Netflix's movies and TV shows.

**Key insights from the dashboard include:**
-----

- Content by Country: A world map highlights the number of movies and TV shows available by country.
- Ratings Distribution: A bar chart shows the frequency of different content ratings, with TV-MA being the most common.
- Genre Popularity: A bar chart displays the top 10 genres, with Documentaries and Stand-Up Comedy ranking the highest.
- Content Type: A distribution chart shows that 68.42% of Netflix's content is movies, while 31.58% are TV shows.
- Yearly Trends: A line chart shows the total movies and TV shows released each year, with a peak in recent years.
